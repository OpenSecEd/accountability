\emph{Summary:}
The need for accountability has been apparent in civilisations for as long as 
they have existed.
One of today's institutions which is historically renowned for keeping strict 
accounts is the state tax office, another is, of course, the banks.
We will explore some principles in keeping accounts and discuss ways to 
implement it in different, sometimes challenging, environments.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
In particular, the \acp{ILO} are that you are able to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{evaluate} advantages and disadvantages of different levels of 
    accountability.
  \item \emph{analyse} a situation and \emph{design} proper accountability and,
    in particular, with privacy considerations.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
Anderson describes accountability through his experience from banks in Chapter 
10 \enquote{Banking and Bookkeeping} in 
   \citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea}.
