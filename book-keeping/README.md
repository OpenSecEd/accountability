*Summary:* The need for accountability has been apparent in
civilisations for as long as they have existed. One of today’s
institutions which is historically renowned for keeping strict accounts
is the state tax office, another is, of course, the banks. We will
explore some principles in keeping accounts and discuss ways to
implement it in different, sometimes challenging, environments.
